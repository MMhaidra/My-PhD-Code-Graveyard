# 🧠 My PhD Code Graveyard

> "It compiles. Ship it." – Every PhD candidate, probably was me at 3 AM

Welcome to my digital attic — a chaotic collection of C++ and Python scripts written between 2018 and 2022 during my PhD. This is where dreams went to segfault, and `print("hello")` was my therapist.

## 🧱 What's in here?

A glorious mess of:
- C++ code that may or may not have memory leaks (spoiler: it does).
- Python scripts that worked *once* on my laptop after I `conda install --force-reinstall everything`.
- Half-finished algorithms, abandoned side projects, and the occasional `# TODO: fix this someday (never)`.
- Data that was "temporary" but is now archaeologically significant.
- Comments like `// I don't know why this works, but don't touch it` and `# This is bad. I am bad.`

All code is provided **as-is**, with no warranty, not even the warranty of "this used to run on my old lab machine".

## 📅 Timeline of Despair (2018–2022)

This repo spans the golden era of:
- Coffee-fueled all-nighters ✅
- `git commit -m "fix"` ✅
- `import numpy as np` ✅
- `std::cout << "why is this segfaulting?" << std::endl;` ✅
- Realizing I reinvented `scipy.optimize` in C++ (RIP my time) ✅

## 🗃️ How It's Structured
It's not.

## ⚠️ Warnings
- Some scripts assume paths like `/home/phduser/lab/data/raw/please-dont-delete/`.
- If you find a script called `final_version_v3_actually_final.py`, there are at least 7 more versions.
- This code has not been audited for style, performance, or emotional stability.

## 💡 Why Share This?

Because:
1. Maybe someone else will laugh *and* learn.
2. Future me needs to remember what `BinaryMap.cpp` was even for.
3. Science is built on shared mistakes.
4. I need to clear space on my old USB drive labeled "PHD_BACKUP_MAYBE".
